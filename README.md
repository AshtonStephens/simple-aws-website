# Task

In a single mono repo:

1. Develop a simple HTTP relay server using a programming language of your choice. The server should have three functionalities:
   - Receive a message, assign a unique number to it, and return the number.
   - Accept a unique number and return the corresponding message.
   - Display the total number of messages stored on the server.

2. Create a user-friendly web app for the server, enabling users to:
   - View the total number of messages on the server.
   - Submit a new message and receive a unique number for it.
   - Enter a unique message number to retrieve the corresponding message.

3. Implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for the project. Ensure that the CI tests the applications.

4. Thoroughly document the deployment process, detailing how developers can deploy, debug, and test the project using local or isolated environments.

Assume that this repo will serve as a starting point for a team of developers and independent contributors. Focus on providing the basic functionalities without incorporating additional features. However, consider various aspects of the project's future development and best practices. Make provisions for the project's potential evolution and scalability, as its direction remains uncertain. Include these considerations in the documentation.
